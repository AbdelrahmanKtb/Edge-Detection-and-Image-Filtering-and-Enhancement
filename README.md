# Edge-Detection-and-Image-Filtering-and-Enhancement
• Implement and compare classic edge detection algorithms like Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny. 
• Explore and implement various image filtering techniques such as Gaussian smoothing, median filtering, and histogram equalization. 
• Include colored image conversion, e.g. RGB, HSI, L*a*b*, YCbCr
